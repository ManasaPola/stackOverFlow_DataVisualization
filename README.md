# StackOverFlow Data Visualization

* The aim of this project is to analyze and visualize Stack Overflow data and represent them interactively. 
* We developed a range of charts like time series, dual axis bar charts, word cloud, scatter plots. 
* We applied sentiment analysis to visualize the positive and negative posts which helps in understanding what is the sentiment of userâ€™s towards Java over time during the year 2018.
* We applied topic modelling on the posts to identify hidden topics in the posts and analyzed each topic separately. Topic modeling helps in identifying hidden clusters in the posts and keywords in the clusters which can be used to auto-generate tags for the posts in a group. 
* Taking into account the major technologies, we analyzed posts from 2013 to create a network of technologies used together.

* The whole visualization is hosted online and is accessible at the link https://shuddh.github.io/.
* Project source code is available at https://github.com/Shuddh Shuddh.github.io.
* The demonstration of the analysis is uploaded https://youtu.be/xgzVO9XW1eg . We added all the interactivity and color coding based on standard formats for better understanding and visual appeal.
